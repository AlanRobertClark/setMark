A Presentation/Workshop on Setting and Marking of Examinations. Based on
the Olde stuff that I put together so many years ago.

First, I will update the olde stuff, then put a Presentation together. Need
to decide what format the presentation takes Beamer, Prosper etc....

Under git.

Possibly paper material?
